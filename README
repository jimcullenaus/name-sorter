This programme takes as an argument the path to a file containing a list of names, which it reads and sorts alphabetically first by last name, then by first names, before writing the sorted file to `$WD/sorted-names-list.txt` and to the console.

The sorting function used is the default C# `string.Sort()` method, including any quirks relating to case sensitivity and non-ASCII characters that may contain.

If any errors occur, including inability to read or write the required files or an incorrectly formatted input file, the programme prints an error to console and exits.

Use: `name-sorter <path-to-input-file>`
